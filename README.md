# snake_the_game
This is my first project on Python. It starts with Beta Version right away, because I didn't use Git creating it.
It's written using a default GUI library TKinter.

The game is a classic Snake game, where you control a snake moving and eating some parts, that appear at the game field from time to time.
The game is over if you run into the field's edge or the body of the snake itself.
You succeed when there is just a little of the field not occupied by the snake.
The game has three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal and Hard. They affect on the snake's speed, how many parts appear at the field at the same time,
and the time while they are visible.
